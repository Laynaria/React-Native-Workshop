# React Native Workshop

This is React Native Official Workshop from Expo, made for learning some special interactions you can do with a mobile device.

I added Typescript on top of it.

What we do in this application:
- Select a picture from a device.
- Add an emoji on it.
- Resize and drag the emoji.
- Save the edited picture.
